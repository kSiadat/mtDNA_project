# Diary

### 2019-07-15
* Created mtDNA_project repository on github
* Researched about mtDNA and started writing an article about it
* Installed [circos](circos.ca)
* Edited system path to add circos to it

### 2019-07-16
* Added suggested changes to the article and repository
* Installed Github desktop
* Created research diary
* Thought about extraxting information from websites with beautiful soup 4
* Created [python program](code/read_mtDNA.py) to parse mtDNA genome, and calculate the proportion of each base in a given range
* Updated the repository structure

### 2019-07-18
* Added suggested changes to the article and repository
	* Changed URLs to [DOIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) where possible
	* Changed reference links to be more scientific or more natural, depending on what was being linked too
* Created system path to python to allow installation of [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* Checked and understood [Conor's code](code/read_mtDNA_CONOR.py)
* Looked up [list comperhension](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python) and a few of python's inbuilt methods
* Looked up how to use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* Used matplotlib to create a function to plot fraction of bases, given a sampling rate and a sample window size. Different window sizes were experimented with in order to see what size gave the most information in the graph.
* Created randomly generated genome, and plotted it in the same way as the actual genome. This was to see if there was any difference between the actual and random genome, so that I could know whether the results from the actual genome were significant or not.

###2019-07-19
* Added axis labels and removed N from the mitochondrial genome graphs
* Wrote a post about the mitochondrial genome graphs
* Learnt how to use beautiful soup 4
