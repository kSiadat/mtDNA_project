# Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)

## Mitochondria
Mitochondria are organelles that are found within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells (cells with a nucleus). There are many (usually around 100) mitochondria within a [human cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_genetics).  They are essential to more sophisticated organisms such as animals, because respiration occurs in the mitochondria, and respiration performed by mitochondria is much more efficient than anaerobic respiration which is the alternative. Mitochondria produce ATP molecules which are used by other parts of the cell to create energy where needed.

Interestingly, much of the [mtDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA) is stored separately from the nucleus. The mitochondria are therefore influenced by two sets of DNA which act quite independently: nuclear DNA and mtDNA in the mitochondria itself.

Mitochondria are believed to have originated from prokaryotic organisms (without a nucleus (e.g. bacteria)) that respired aerobically, and which were living with anaerobic eukaryotic cells in a mutual symbiotic relationship ([Tuppen et al. (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2009.09.005)).

## mtDNA
mtDNA is unusual for multiple reasons.  Firstly it is not part of the nuclear DNA kept in the nucleus. Instead it is kept within the mitochondria. This means that it works differently to the way that nuclear DNA works [wiki_mtDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA). For example base pair encoding used in mtDNA varies slightly from that used in nuclear DNA. [mtDNA_diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002618?via%3Dihub)

A major feature of mtDNA is that it has a much higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA. [mtDNA_diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002618?via%3Dihub)

There are also multiple whole copies of a mitochondria's mtDNA within it (usually about 6 - 10), they all have the ability to exchange mtDNA with each other. [mtDNA_diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002618?via%3Dihub)

Another way in which mtDNA is distinct from nuclear DNA is that it does not fully replicate in time with the phases of the cell cycle, even though mtDNA replication and maintenance is controlled by nuclear DNA. The way it works is that there is relaxed replication which is not coupled to chromosome replication, this is the kind that is independent of the cell cycle. Then there is also stringent replication, this is coupled to chromosome replication, meaning it is in time with the phases of the cell cycle [mtDNA_diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002618?via%3Dihub). These 2 types of replictaion create an overall effect where mtDNA replicates constantly, but replicates more at certain phases of the cell cycle in order to be ready for cell division [bacterial_plasmids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC413948/?page=8).

Nuclear DNA is very long and resembles a string, this means that it has to have a way of finishing off the ends of the DNA molecule. Mitochondria get around this problem by having a circular loop of mtDNA, so it has no start or end (Conor Lawless). Circular DNA is a feature of prokaryotes, which is why mitochondria are thought to have originated from them.

Unlike most DNA where half of the genetic material is inherited from each parent, mtDNA is only ever completely inherited from the mother of the person. [wiki_human_mtDNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_genetics)

## mtDNA diseases
Mitochondrial diseases are caused in 2 main ways, and they are all currently not possible to treat by actually correcting the defects in the mtDNA [mt-tRNA diseases](https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.1002/emmm.201303202). These diseases can also occur at any age, although it is often hereditary and therefore occurs at birth. The type and severity the of disease impacts on the progression, sometimes the disease gets worse and worse over time, whereas sometimes it appears and then the patient gradually recovers from it (often only partially) [mtDNA_diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002618?via%3Dihub).

The first way is When there are certain mutations in mtDNA or nuclear DNA. mtDNA mutations occur a lot more frequently than nuclear DNA mutations, however most of those mutations are neutral (they do not affect the mitochondria positively or negatively). mtDNA are also prone to being damaged by oxidation. [mtDNA_diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002618?via%3Dihub)

The second way is when sections of mtDNA are deleted. The amount of deletions in a tissue has the largest effect on diseases, instead of the size of individual deletions. [mtDNA_diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002618?via%3Dihub)

The amount of mutations is often called 'mutation load', this is different to heteroplasmy (Conor Lawless). There is a critical mass of mutation load for whether or not negative mutations in the mitochondria will cause disease, which varies with how much the given tissue depends on mitochondria. [mtDNA_diseases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002618?via%3Dihub)

## Using circos with mtDNA
Circos is a tool that creates circular diagrams programatically using a dataset. It is well suited to mtDNA, because mtDNA is already in a loop as mentioned earlier. The diagrams produced by circos are good for showing relationships between large amounts of elements, it also looks nice.
