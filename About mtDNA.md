# About mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)

## About this repository
This repository is about mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). More specifically it is about human mitochondrial genetics, and how mtDNA is involved with diseases called mitochondrial disorders.

## About mitochondria
Mitochondria are organelles that are found within eukaryotic cells (cells with a nucleus). Within 1 cell, there will be many mitochondria.\
They are an essential to more sophisticated organisms such as animals, because respiration occurs in the mitochondria, and respiration performed by mitochondria is much more efficient than anaerobic respiration which is the alternative.\
Mitochondria are believed to have originated from prokaryotic organisms (without a nucleus (e.g. bacteria)) that respired aerobically, and which were living with anaerobic eukaryotic cells in a mutual symbiotic relationship.\

## About mtDNA
mtDNA is unusual for multiple reasons.\
Firstly it is not part of the nuclear DNA kept in the nucleus. Instead it is kept within the mitochondria. This means that it works differently to the way that nuclear DNA works. For example the base pair encoding used in mtDNA varies slightly from that used in nuclear DNA.Another way in which mtDNA is seperate from nuclear DNA is that it does not replicate in time with the phases of the cell cycle.\
Nuclear DNA is very long and resembles a string, this means that it has to have a way of finishing off the ends of the DNA molecule. Mitochondria get around this problem by having a circular loop of mtDNA, so it has no start or end. Circular DNA is a feature of prokaryotes, which is why mitochondria are thought to have originated from them.\
Unlike most DNA where half of the genetic material is inherited from each parent, mtDNA is only ever completley in herited from the mother of the person.\
