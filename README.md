# Drawing circular mtDNA genomes

This project is about visualising and annotating circular mtDNA genomes.

+ [Introduction](posts/about_mtDNA.md)
	+ What are mitochondria?
	+ What is mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)?
	+ Why is mtDNA interesting?

 + [Prevalence of nucleobases a long the length of the mitochondrial genome](posts/nucleobase_plots.md)
 	+ How do nucleobases vary a long the genome?
	+ How does an actual genome compare to a random one in terms of bases?
	+ Why would you compare them?

 + [Obtaining data about the location of genes in the mitochondrial genome](posts/obtaining_gene_location_data.md)
 	+ Why is that data important?
	+ How to get the data
 + [mtDNA images](posts/mtdna_images.md)
 	+ A set of diagrams created using circos
